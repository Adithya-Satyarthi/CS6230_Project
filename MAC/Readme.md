We have uploaded three folders macint32, macfp32 and topmodule. 
To run the code clone the folder and run the following commands 
  1. pyenv activate py38
  2. make generate_verilog
  3. make simulate
We have defined coverage for both the individual int and float modules but not for the topmodule. 

Assignment 1:

1. int32 :
  a. pipelined design: code - not-completed, verification - not-completed
  b. unpipeined design : code - completed, verification - completed

2. bfloat16:
  a. pipelined design: code - not-completed, verification - not-completed
  b. unpipeined design : code - completed, verification - completed

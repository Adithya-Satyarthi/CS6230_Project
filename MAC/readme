We have uploaded three folders macint32, macfp32 and topmodule. 
To run the code clone the folder and run the following commands 
  1. pyenv activate py38
  2. make generate_verilog
  3. make simulate
We have defined coverage for both the individual int and float modules but not for the topmodule. (have included only positive values in the coverage for float)

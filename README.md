# CS6230 Project: MAC Unit Design and Verification

This project is part of the CS6230: CAD for VLSI course. The objective is to design and verify(using Cocotb) a Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) unit that supports the following operations:
- **Integer Mode**: (A: int8, B: int8, C: int32) → (MAC: int32)
- **Floating-Point Mode**: (A: bf16, B: bf16, C: fp32) → (MAC: fp32)
